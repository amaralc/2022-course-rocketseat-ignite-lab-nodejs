- Architecture
  - Database should be no more than a choice of tool for the persistance layer;
  - Try to develop the applications independently of the database choice;
  - A software entity do not necessarily have a 1:1 relationship to a database table (or document);
    - Sometimes an entity has no corresponding table (or documents);
    - Sometimes an entity might be represented by two or more tables (or documents);

</br>

- Classes
  - Getters and Setters are used to prevent local properties from being mutated with no restrictions;
